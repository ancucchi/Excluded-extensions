# Extensions excluded from indexing

When using indexing programs, I exclude files with the following extensions from indexing.
Some because I believe they lack useful indexable data (such as AVI or BMP files), others, email containers (such as DBX, PST, and OST files), because I convert them into individual emails in EML format before indexing.<br>

*.3g *.ai *.aif *.aiff *.avi *.bin *.bmp *.cab *.chi *.chm *.com *.db *.dbx *.dbx *.dll *.emlx *.exe *.exp *.gif *.hlp *.hqx *.idb *.ilk *.iso *.ivi *.ivt *.ix *.lib *.mkv *.mov *.mp4 *.mpe *.mpeg *.mpg *.msg *.msi *.nls *.obj *.ocx *.opt *.ost *.pch *.pdb *.psp *.pst *.ram *.res *.rm *.rmi *.snd *.sys *.tif *.tlh *.tmp *.trg *.ttf *.vbx *.wav *.wma *.wmv *.wpg *.xfd DRVSPACE.*   "Export and Bookmark Files Based On Extension Results.csv"
