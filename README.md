# Extensions excluded from indexing

When using indexing programs, I exclude files with the following extensions from indexing.  
Some because I believe they lack useful indexable data (such as AVI or BMP files), others, email containers (such as DBX, PST, and OST files), because I convert them into individual emails in EML format before indexing.<br>
